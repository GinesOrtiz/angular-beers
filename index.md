# Contribs & Interests

You have to submit your interest, the goal is create separated groups by different interests to interact together

> For example:
>#interest: create a chrome extension, thens submit your [interest to next meetup discussion](http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-Beers/messages/boards/thread/48884172)
or [open an issue](https://github.com/angularbeers/angular-beers/issues) to AngularBeers.
>

We will have separated tables organized by groups with common interests to interact together

If you have any idea / project to share [contact organizer](http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-Beers/members/?op=leaders) or [submit an issue]
(https://github.com/angularbeers/angular-beers/issues)

**Remember:** AngularJS & Beers is an open-space where you can share, express your ideas and work in team: You decide what will happen, we don't provide any kind of workshops. Share your interests and help others with your contributions.
